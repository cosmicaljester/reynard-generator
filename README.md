### The internal name that for now, is just the name of the script.
Built on Python 3.12, running under a Windows host

Reynard is a script made to assist in making characters, whether generating an entire sheet, individual segments, or just providing a template.
### No AI is used in this script. For now the script is entirely local, with future potential for remotely updating the variables file (vixen.py).
