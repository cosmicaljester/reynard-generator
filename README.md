# Reynard
### The internal name that for now, is just the name of the script.
Built on Python 3.12, running under a Windows host

Reynard is a script made to assist in making characters, whether generating (most of) an entire sheet, individual segments, or just providing a template.
### No AI is used in this script. The script is entirely local.
If you're wondering, the names are fox themed. And taken from Wikipedia, so, dubiously accurate.

I'm fully aware that a lot of it isn't optimized, I'm still not an expert in the slightest.
